## Hi, I'm Jenny Stevens, VFX Artist and aspiring Software Developer.
## After 13 years of making things go boom and sparkle as an artist in videogames, I now plan to follow my passion and knack for problem solving as software engineer. <br>

## I enjoy all kinds of games and fictions, learning new things, and I feel a strong responsibility towards society and our planet. <br>

> ## I have worked with C#, Dart, Java and JavaScript, dabbled in MEL and python, and I am confident in my ability to pick up new tech stacks on the go. <br> <br>
