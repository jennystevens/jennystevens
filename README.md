## Hi, I'm Jenny Stevens, Realtime VFX Artist and aspiring Software Developer.
## I've been making things go boom and sparkle as an artist in videogames for 13 years now, and recently discovered my love for coding. <br>

## I enjoy all kinds of games and fictions, learning new things, and I feel a strong responsibility towards society and our planet. <br>

> ## I have worked with C#, Dart, Java and JavaScript, dabbled in MEL and python, and I am confident in my ability to pick up new tech stacks on the go. <br> <br>
